# VLSync

VLSync is a network-synced video player built on [libVLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html) and the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/) for letting multiple users watch pre-downloaded videos together over the long distance, with virtually zero lag, little latency, and full quality.

VLSync was originally written with a [Python frontend](https://github.com/Noorquacker/VLSync/blob/main/FREAKING_VLSYNC.py) which proved to be complicated for the user to install, so we switched to a Rust frontend because it is ***BLAZING FAST*** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

The backend is written in PHP and is to be published whenever I figure out how Git branching works, when I recover from accidentally deleting the database, and when I export the database structure as an sql file to prevent it from happening again.
